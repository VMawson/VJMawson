Ingredients:

75g hazelnuts

50g caster sugar

100g golden syrup

140g unsalted butter

1/4 tsp salt

150g nutella

320g oats

Method:

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C/ 160 C fan. Line a 20cm x 20cm tray with parchment. 

2. If the hazelnuts are still in their skins, place on a baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until fragant and skins are cracking.

3. Pour the nuts into a clean tea towel. Close the towel into a bundle around the nuts and shake vigourously, rubbing the nuts against the cloth. This will help remove the skins.

4. Open up the towel bundle, and carefully peel any nuts which still have skins in tack. Once skinned, chop roughly.

5. Place the caster sugar, golden syrup and butter into a large pan. Gently heat until melted. Remove from the heat.

6. Mix the salt and hazelnuts into the oats. 

7. Add the nutella to the syrup pan, stirring to melt.

8. Add the oats to the pan, and mix until fully combined.

9. Press into the lined baking tray, and bake for 20-25 mins. The centre may feel a little soft but will firm up when cooled. 

10. Leave to cool in the tray for 45mins before turning out and chopping into squares.
