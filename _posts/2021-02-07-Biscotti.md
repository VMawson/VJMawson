Ingredients:

252g plain flour

50g cocoa powder 

168g caster sugar + 2tsp for topping

1 1/2 tsp baking powder

1/4 tsp salt

2 eggs

1 egg yolk

100g chopped pistachios

1tbsp milk, for glaze

Method:
1. Preheat oven to 230 C. Add all ingredients minus the pistachios to a large bowl in a stand mixer and beat to form a smooth dough. Alternatively mix with a wooden spoon.
2. Using your hands, knead the pistachios into the dough.
3. tip the dough onto a floured work surface, and divide into 4 pieces. 
4. Roll each piece into logs 2inches wide.
5. Place on a baking tray lined with parcement paper, leaving 2inches between the logs.
6. Glaze with milk, and sprinkle over the caster sugar. 
7. Bake for approx 20mins, until no longer doughy and shiny, yet still soft.
8. Lower oven temp to 150C.
9. Remove the logs from the oven, and cut into 1inch thick slices. If the log is still wet inside, return to the oven for another 5mins. Lay each slice onto the tray, and bake for 15mins until firm.
10. Remove from the oven and the baking tray, and allow to cool on a wire rack to crisp up more.
11. Store in an air tight container.
