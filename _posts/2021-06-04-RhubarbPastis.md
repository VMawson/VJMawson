Dough....
---

1. preheat the oven to 180 C.
2. Mix together the flour, salt and water until a soft dough forms which just holds together. Set aside for 30mins.
3. Lightly flour your work surface and roll dough to a 20cm x 20cm square. Using a butter knife, lightly spread the 1/3 of the softened butter over 2/3 of the dough square- leaving a strip down one side which is butter free.
4. Fold this unbuttered side over half of the buttered area. Fold the other buttered 1/3 dough. You should have formed a new rectangle of dough with 3 layers.
5. Turn the dough 90 degrees, so that a fold is facing you rather than an edge. Roll out again to a 20 x 20 cm square. Spread over another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the dough and repeat the folding process. 
6. Again, turn the dough 90 degrees, roll into a 25 x 20cm rectangle. Spread over the remaining butter. With the long side facing you, roll the dough into a log, brushing away any excess flour as you roll. Wrap the log and rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours. meanwhile, make the custard and rhubarb.

Custard....

1. Add the flour to a bowl, and whisk in 25ml milk until well mixed. 
2. In a pan, slowly heat the sugar and water until it reached 104C.
3. Heat the remaining milk until almost boiling. Whisk this slowly into the flour milk mix, whisking well.
4. Similarly, slowly pour the sugar syrup mixture into  the milk, whisking well. 
5. Add the vanilla and lemon zest.
6. In a bowl, whisk together the 3 egg yolks. Drizzle this slowly into the milk mixture, whisking continuously as you add the egg. Set aside to cool.

Rhubarb....

1. Wash the rhubarb, trim the ends and and cut into 18 7cm batons. Toss with the lemon juice and sugar. Place on a lined baking tray, and roast in the preheated oven for 10mins until starting to soften. Set aside.

Assembly and baking....
----

1. Preheat the oven to 270C. Remove the dough from the fridge, and trim the edges off the log. Using a ruler, measure along the log, divide and cut the log into 9 equal portions. 
2. Using a muffin tin, place  a slice of dough, cut side down into each well of the tin. Using your thumb, press the dough down, and gently shape it up the edges of the muffin tin to form a cup shape. try to keep the spiral shape of the dough as you shape it, the bottom of the cup should be thinner than the sides but there should be no holes in the dough. 
3. Repeat with all 9 pieces of dough.
4. Fill each cup 3/4 full with the custard. Bake in the oven for 12mins, or until the tops are beginning to set. Working quickly, remove  the pastries from the oven and place 2 rhubarb batons on each tart. Return to the oven for another 5minutes. 
5. Give the tin a jiggle, if the tarts still look runny in the centre, return to the oven for another 2-4 mins. They will firm up on cooling. 
6. Cool in the tin for 15 mins before removing and cooling on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.
